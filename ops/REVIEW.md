# Translations waiting for a native-speaker check

## AI cross-review (no native reviewer available) — method, 2026-11-08
1. Extract the target-language strings only (no English) from `ops/review/<lang>.md`.
2. A fresh reviewer agent that never sees the English back-translates each string literally and lists native-reader
   problems (grammar, unnatural wording, wrong term, register, Unicode), with a corrected version.
3. A second fresh agent back-translates only the corrections. Claude compares both back-translations with the English
   source and accepts a correction only if the meaning still matches (hedges like "may" kept, numbers unchanged).
4. Apply with `build/apply_translation_fixes.py` — it replaces whole strings by key only. (A first version replaced
   substrings and changed unrelated text, e.g. a short Burmese word inside 'tax'; caught before deploy and redone.)
   Rerun all tests, rebuild review sheets, ship through the normal approval.
This catches meaning errors and obvious unnatural wording, but it is still machine judgement: real users' reports
(the "translation mistake?" link on every page → GitHub issue) stay the final check.

### Done
- 2026-11-08 my + ne: leaving-japan, resident-tax (all strings + FAQ) and all 120 kanji-work words. my: 41 flagged,
  37 corrections applied, 4 rejected (2 kept original wording, 2 replaced by better terms: 図面, 通勤手当); hedges fixed
  ("may not be approved"). ne: 34 flagged, 32 applied, 2 rejected (排泄, 転出届 kept). Consistent terms now:
  my 通勤手当 = အလုပ်သွားလာစရိတ် ထောက်ပံ့ငွေ, 差引支給額 = အသားတင် လက်ခံရငွေ; ne "पेन्सन (नेन्किन)".
- 2026-11-08 my + ne round 2: takehome, payslip, nenkin-refund, kanji-grade/kanji-work UI and FAQs. my: 53 flagged,
  46 applied (4 rejected: 'prefecture' rendered as 'district', a refund line that became 'part of', an eligibility line
  that became ambiguous, 1 style-only). ne: 31 flagged, 30 applied (1 rejected: bonus hint changed meaning).
  Many fixes hedge firm claims ("usually", "may") and fix terms (Burmese 子ども・子育て支援金 no longer reads as an allowance
  you receive; kun label no longer reads as 'tax').
- 2026-11-08 vi + id (all strings, ~390 each): vi 32 flagged / 32 applied, id 14 flagged / 14 applied (1 adjusted).
  Found two content issues that also affected en/ja/ne/my and were fixed in all six languages:
  (1) "giving or selling your phone or SIM is illegal" was too broad → now "a SIM card or phone line in your name";
  (2) "you can get most of this back" (payslip, pension) → "part of this back (up to a limit)" in en/ja/vi/id.
- 2026-11-09 takehome FAQ new Q (bonus income tax, 5th item): vi/ne/id/my cross-reviewed; 0 meaning errors, wording fixes
  applied in all four (vi 'được'/'tiền thuế là', id 'tabel tarif pajak bonus'/'dikalikan', my subject 'အခွန်ကို' + 'တွက်ချက်',
  ne 'बीमा शुल्क'); second back-translation matched the English.
- 2026-11-09 (2) bonus '10×' wording (bSpecial + FAQ, both amounts 'after insurance'): cross-reviewed, meaning OK in all 4;
  applied: my 'နုတ်ပြီးသော' (adjectival, key fix) + sentence split, ne comma, id 'yang juga sudah dipotong', vi 'vượt quá'/'thì'.
  Rejected: new insurance terms (my လူမှုဖူလုံရေး…, id iuran asuransi sosial) to keep site-wide terms; added 'because' clauses.
- 2026-11-09 (3) kanji-work 'fishing' set (12 words + topic name + lede): readings checked blind (all 12 match, single standard
  reading), glosses back-translated blind; applied ne topic grammar, ne 漁港 reorder, ne 船酔い calque removed, my 餌 = feed/bait,
  vi 'và'. Kept my topic ငါးလုပ်ငန်း (ရေလုပ်ငန်း is the official term; consider).
- Status: all four languages AI-cross-reviewed once. Next: re-run after each text change; watch GitHub issues.

## How to get a free review (plan, 2026-11-08)
- Review sheets: `ops/review/<lang>.md` (vi, ne, id, my, ja). Each lists every string next to the English, with a
  "correction" column. Regenerate after any text change: `python3 build/export_review.py`.
- Share the GitHub link of one sheet with a native speaker you know (friend, coworker, language-exchange partner).
  They can reply with corrections in any form; Claude applies them, rebuilds and asks for approval as usual.
- Priority order: 1) kanji-work safety words and leaving-japan/resident-tax steps (wrong = real harm),
  2) calculators' labels and notes, 3) FAQ, 4) everything else. Burmese (my) first, then Nepali (ne).
- No paid services or companies. Credit reviewers only if they want it (first name or handle), never the owner.
